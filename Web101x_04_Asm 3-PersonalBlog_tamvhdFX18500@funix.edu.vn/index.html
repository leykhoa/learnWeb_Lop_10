                            Last week flew by and before I knew it, it was time to plan the menu for
                            Sunday dinner. Sunday have been a perfect opportunity for me to 
                            experiment dessert recipes, especially those that serve tons of people,
                            since we have help polishing it all off and don't have it sitting around
                            the house, tempting us for days.

                        <h2>German Chocolate Cake</h2>
                        <img src="./images/german-chocolate-cake.jpg" alt="">

                            I have long associated German Chocolate Cake with Father's Day, although
                            I'm not entirely sure why. I think I remember my mom making it for my
                            dad once or twice growing up (althought never on Father's Day,
                            ironically) and the correlation must have stuck somewhere along the way.
