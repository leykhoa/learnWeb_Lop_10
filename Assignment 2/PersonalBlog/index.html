						<p>
							Last week flew by and before I knew it, it was time to plan the menu for
							Sunday dinner. Sunday have been a perfect opportunity for me to
							experiment dessert recipes, especially those that serve tons of people,
							since we have help polishing it all off and don't have it sitting around
							the house, tempting us for days.

						<h2>German Chocolate Cake</h2>
						<img src="./images/german-chocolate-cake.jpg" alt="" />
						<br />
						<p>
							I have long associated German Chocolate Cake with Father's Day, although
							I'm not entirely sure why. I think I remember my mom making it for my
							dad once or twice growing up (althought never on Father's Day,
							ironically) and the correlation must have stuck somewhere along the way.
